# StudyPlatform
StudyPlatform is my project for Softuni's C# Web Advanced Course. 
The site will function as a center where users can find topics for different subjects.
The site has two primary users: User and Teacher. Users can view content while Teachers can upload, edit and delete it.
The site is using the United Bootstrap theme. https://bootswatch.com/united/
