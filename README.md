# StudyPlatform
StudyPlatform is my project for Softuni's C# Web Advanced Course. 
The site will function as a center where users can find topics.
The site has two roles:
  - Students, who can engage with the lessons' presentations and homeworks
  - Teachers, who can create new lessons for specific courses
